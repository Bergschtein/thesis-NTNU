\section{Stage 1}

As mentioned in the section on representation learning, one needs to determine a set of tasks one wish to evaluate on, in order to say anything about the quality of the representations. We evaluate the representations based on two tasks

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Reconstruction}: We evaluate the models ability to reconstruct the original data from latent representation. Success indicating perservation of information.
    \item \textbf{Downstream classification}: We evaluate the latent representations on its ability  linear classification. 
\end{itemize}
