\TODO{Thought: }
Better inception score and CAS of our models indicate that the class separability learned in latent space makes the conditional distributions more distinct easier to classify. The FID is variable, but in many cases better, which indicated that the generative distributions are closer to the ground truth.

\section{Further work}
\cite{morningstar2024augmentations} suggest that focus on augmentations is of great importance. The hunt for good augmentations in the time series domain is ongoing and should probably get more attention.\newline
HF-LF split - augmentations tailored for HF and LF, as they often have quite different semantics.\newline

Further optimize the relationship between aug recon loss and choice of augmentations.
